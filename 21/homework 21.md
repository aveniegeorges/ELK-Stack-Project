About the Case Report
Kali Linux is a Linux-based distribution used mainly for penetration testing and digital forensics. It has a wide range of tools to help in forensics investigations and incident response mechanisms.

Me and My Team start by understanding the fundamentals of digital forensics and setting up our Kali Linux environment to perform different investigation practices. First will delve into the realm of operating systems and the various formats for file storage. The Case Report we did will also teach you to create forensic images of data and maintain integrity using Autopzy tools. Next, you will also master some advanced topics such as autopsies and acquiring investigation data from the network, operating system memory, and so on. We will introduces you to powerful tools that will take your forensic abilities and investigations to a professional level, catering for all aspects of full digital forensic investigations from the Case reporting.

We will have had hands-on experience in implementing all the pillars of digital forensicsâ€”acquisition, extraction, analysis, and presentation using Kali Linux, and Autopzy tools.
